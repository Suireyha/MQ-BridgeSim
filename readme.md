# Bridge Logic Simulation
A simple web app for my ENGG2000 course at Macquarie University.
This app just simulates the input/ouput logic for when the motion sensor detects a ship underneath the bridge.

## Instructions
Click the 'Simulate Motion Detector' button underneath the bridge.

## Features
- After motion has been detected, the warning light sequence begins, alerting drivers that the bridge is soon to lift

- The bridge lifts after the warning sequence
